2. Definition of Bribery

Bribery is the offering, promising, giving, accepting, or soliciting of an undue advantage of any value (which could be financial or non-financial), directly or indirectly, in order to influence improperly the actions of another person.

Bribery can occur whether the advantage is offered or received by:
	•	employees,
	•	suppliers,
	•	customers,
	•	government officials,
	•	or any other parties.

It does not matter if:
	•	the bribe is actually accepted or paid,
	•	or if the intended influence was successful.

The mere offer, promise, or request can constitute bribery.
